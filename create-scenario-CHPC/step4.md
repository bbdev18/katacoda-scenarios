## "I know kung fu..."

Not quite, but we know a little Python now. Let us do more interesting things.
First off let us have a look at conditions. For example, if a number `x = 42` check if it is greater than a certain number. If it is, print true, if not print false.

Input the following:

```
x = 42
if x > 40:
 print("Yes x is greater than 40, it is: " + str(x))
else:
 print("No x is not greater than 40, it is: " + str(x))
```{{execute}}

You should see `...`, press enter to run the condition.

Can you explain what this did?

And a loops, lets look at a for loop.

Input the following:

```
for i in range(10):
 print(i)

```{{execute}}

You should see `...`, press enter to run the condition.

Can you explain what this did?

That is all for now!

To exit the Python terminal input the command `exit()`{{execute}}.

This is where the fun begins - dodging bullets! 

Welcome to the world of Python. First things first lets see if Python is available to use. We do this by checking if a version of Python exists. Input the command `python3 --version`, note depending on how Python was setup you can also use `python --version`. It should show `Python 3.6.9`, great lets jump in - you took the red pill right?

Input the command `python3`{{execute}}, a python terminal should appear.

Lets start off with some variables and simple maths functions. Try out the following commands and I will explain afterwards what is happening:

`40+2`{{execute}}

`print(40+2)`{{execute}}

`name = "wabbit"`{{execute}}

`print(name)`{{execute}}

`x = 40`{{execute}}

`y = 2`{{execute}}

`x`{{execute}}

`y`{{execute}}

`answer_to_the_question_of_life = x + y`{{execute}}

`print(answer_to_the_question_of_life)`{{execute}}

First off we did some basic math like adding two numbers, also known as integers, `40+2`, and you should have seen the answer as `42` which is also an integer. We can also print that answer as text, which we call a string, with `print(40 + 2)`. We also made a variable called `name` which stores the text `"wabbit"`. Note the two exclamation marks `" "`, makes sure the variable is stored as text, this is also known as a string. 

We then just started assigning some variables like `x = 40` and `y = 2` which will be stored so we can use it later. We can print out what those variables represent at any time if you just input `x` and `y`. The we are made a sum `answer_to_the_question_of_life = x + y` which we then printed out on the terminal using the `print` function: `print(answer_to_the_question_of_life)`. 

Take note that we mentioned the words integer and string which fall under the category of data types. We will discuss data types in later lessons.

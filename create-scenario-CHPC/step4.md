## "I know kung fu..."

Not quite, but we know a little Python now. Let us do more interesting things.
First off let us have a look at conditions. For example, if a number `x = 42` check if it is greater than a certain number. If it is, print true, if not print false.

Input the following:

```python
x = 42
if x > 40:
 print(`Yes x is greater than 42`)
else:
 print(`No x is not greater than 42`)
```

And a loops, lets look at a for loop.

Input the following:

```python
for i in range(10):
 print(i)
```
